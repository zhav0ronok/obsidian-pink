# ObsidianPink
A cute, pink and minimal Obsidian theme, based on the [HyprPink](https://github.com/zhav0ronok/hyprpink) color scheme.

***

### Suggested Fonts:

The font I used in my [theme.css](https://github.com/zhav0ronok/obsidian-pink/blob/main/theme.css) is the Iosevka Nerd Font. If you do not have this installed, Obsidian will use the default font instead. You can download this font [here](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) (or any other font of your choosing). 

### Additional Configuration:

In the ```Appearance``` section of your Settings, I suggest setting the Accent Color to ```203, 36, 113``` and similarly picking colors for your Groups in the graph view that match with the rest of the theme. I use the visual editor to select various shades of pink.

Aside from that, I find that this theme works very well with the following plugins:
* Folder Notes
* Google Calendar
* Iconize
* Latex Suite
* Templater
* Image Border Style (optional)

More features to be added soon!
